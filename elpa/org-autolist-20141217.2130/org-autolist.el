;;; Commentary:

;; `org-autolist` makes org-mode lists behave more like lists in non-programming
;; editors such as Google Docs, MS Word, and OS X Notes.
;;
;; When editing a list item, pressing "Return" will insert a new list item
;; automatically. This works for both bullet points and checkboxes, so there's
;; no need to think about whether to use `M-<return>` or `M-S-<return>`. Similarly,
;; pressing "Backspace" at the beginning of a list item deletes the bullet /
;; checkbox, and moves the cursor to the end of the previous line.

;;; Usage:

;; To enable org-autolist mode in the current buffer:
;;
;;   (org-autolist-mode)
;;
;; To enable it whenever you open an org file, add this to your init.el:
;;
;;   (add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda () (org-autolist-mode)))

;;; Code:
(require 'org)
(require 'org-element)

  "Returns the position before the first character after the
bullet of the current list item"

  outdents the item, or clears it if it's already at the outermost
  indentation level."
